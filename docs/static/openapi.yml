                        A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of
                        the serialized

                        protocol buffer message. This string must contain at
                        least

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                        must represent

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer
                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".



                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
                          "value": "1.212s"
                        }

                              scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can

                          representation of the deserialized, embedded message,
                          with an

                          additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                          Example:

                              package google.profile;
                              message Person {
                                string first_name = 1;
                                string last_name = 2;
                              }

                              {
                                "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                                "firstName": <string>,
                                "lastName": <string>
                              }

                          If the embedded message type is well-known and has a
                          custom JSON

                          representation, that representation will be embedded
                          adding a field

                          `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                          `@type`

                          field. Example (for message

                        A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of
                        the serialized

                        protocol buffer message. This string must contain at
                        least

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                        must represent

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer
                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".



                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
                          "value": "1.212s"

                            In practice, teams usually precompile into the

                            expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for

                            scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can
                            optionally set up a type

                            follows:


                            * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                            * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a

                              value in binary format, or produce an error.

                            based on the

                              lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                              on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                              breaking changes.)

                    `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer
                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".



                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                      URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                      Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any
                      values in the form

                      of utility functions or additional generated methods of
                      the Any type.


                      Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                            ...

                          }

                       Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                          foo = Foo(...)

                      The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by

                      JSON

                      ====

                      The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                      representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                      an

                      additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                      Example:

                          package google.profile;
                          message Person {
                            string first_name = 1;
                            string last_name = 2;
                          }

                          {
                            "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",

                            "lastName": <string>
                          }

                      If the embedded message type is well-known and has a
                      custom JSON

                      representation, that representation will be embedded
                      adding a field

                      `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                      `@type`

                      field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        on the

                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs

                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);

                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);

                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield

                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                      represent

                      the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                      In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary all
                      types that they

                      expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for URLs
                      which use the

                      scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                      set up a type

                      server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                      follows:


                      * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                      * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                      [google.protobuf.Type][]
                        value in binary format, or produce an error.
                      * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                      on the
                        URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                        lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                        on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                        breaking changes.)

                      Note: this functionality is not currently available in the
                      official

                      protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                      beginning with

                      type.googleapis.com.


                      Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                      might be

                      used with implementation specific semantics.

                  `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer message
                  along with a

                  URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                  Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values in
                  the form

                  of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                  Any type.


                  Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                      Foo foo = ...;
                      Any any;
                      any.PackFrom(foo);

                        ...
                      }

                  Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                      Foo foo = ...;
                      Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                      ...
                      if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                        foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                      }

                   Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                      foo = Foo(...)
                      any = Any()
                      any.Pack(foo)
                      ...
                      if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                        any.Unpack(foo)
                        ...

                   Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                       foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                       any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                       if err != nil {
                         ...
                       }
                       ...
                       foo := &pb.Foo{}
                       if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                         ...
                       }

                  The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default
                  use

                  'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                  unpack

                  methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last
                  '/'

                  in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                  type

                  name "y.z".



                  JSON

                  ====

                  The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                  representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an

                  additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example:

                      package google.profile;
                      message Person {
                        string first_name = 1;
                        string last_name = 2;
                      }

                      {
                        "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                        "firstName": <string>,
                        "lastName": <string>
                      }

                  If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                  JSON

                  representation, that representation will be embedded adding a
                  field

                  `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type`

                  field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                      {
                        "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a

                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);

                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".



                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)

                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".



                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
                          "value": "1.212s"

                        the serialized

                        protocol buffer message. This string must contain at
                        least

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                        must represent

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)

                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}

                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".



                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
                          "value": "1.212s"

                      A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of
                      the serialized

                      protocol buffer message. This string must contain at least

                      one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path must
                      represent

                      the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                      `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in a
                      canonical form

                      (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                      In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary all
                      types that they

                      expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for URLs
                      which use the

                      scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                      set up a type

                      server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                      follows:


                      * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                      * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                      [google.protobuf.Type][]
                        value in binary format, or produce an error.
                      * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                      on the
                        URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                        lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                        on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                        breaking changes.)

                      Note: this functionality is not currently available in the
                      official

                      protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                      beginning with

                      type.googleapis.com.


                      Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                      might be

                      used with implementation specific semantics.

                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".



                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
                          "value": "1.212s"

                        least

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                        must represent

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer
                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".



                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                              ...
                            }

                        Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                            Foo foo = ...;
                            Any any = Any.pack(foo);

                              foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                            }

                         Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                            foo = Foo(...)
                            any = Any()
                            any.Pack(foo)
                            ...
                            if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                              any.Unpack(foo)
                              ...

                         Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                             foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                             any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                             if err != nil {
                               ...
                             }
                             ...
                             foo := &pb.Foo{}
                             if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                               ...
                             }

                        The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                        default use

                        'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and
                        the unpack

                        methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                        last '/'

                        in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will
                        yield type

                        name "y.z".



                        JSON

                        ====

                        The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the
                        regular

                        representation of the deserialized, embedded message,
                        with an

                        additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                        Example:

                            package google.profile;
                            message Person {
                              string first_name = 1;
                              string last_name = 2;
                            }

                            {
                              "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                              "firstName": <string>,
                              "lastName": <string>
                            }

                        If the embedded message type is well-known and has a
                        custom JSON

                        representation, that representation will be embedded
                        adding a field

                        `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                        `@type`

                        field. Example (for message

                        protocol buffer message. This string must contain at
                        least

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                        must represent

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                  description: >-
                    `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer
                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".



                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {

                            type of the serialized

                            protocol buffer message. This string must contain at
                            least

                            one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's
                            path must represent

                            the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                            `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be
                            in a canonical form

                            (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                            In practice, teams usually precompile into the
                            binary all types that they

                            expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                            URLs which use the

                            scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can
                            optionally set up a type

                            server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                            follows:


                            * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                            * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                            [google.protobuf.Type][]
                              value in binary format, or produce an error.
                            * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results
                            based on the
                              URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                              lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                              on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                              breaking changes.)

                            Note: this functionality is not currently available
                            in the official

                            protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                            beginning with

                            type.googleapis.com.


                            Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty
                            scheme) might be

                            used with implementation specific semantics.

                        `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer
                        message along with a

                        URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                        Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any
                        values in the form

                        of utility functions or additional generated methods of
                        the Any type.


                        Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                            Foo foo = ...;
                            Any any;
                            any.PackFrom(foo);
                            ...
                            if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                              ...
                            }

                        Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                            Foo foo = ...;
                            Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                            ...
                            if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                              foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                            }

                         Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                            foo = Foo(...)
                            any = Any()
                            any.Pack(foo)
                            ...
                            if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                              any.Unpack(foo)
                              ...

                         Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                             foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                             any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                             if err != nil {
                               ...
                             }
                             ...
                             foo := &pb.Foo{}
                             if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                               ...
                             }

                        The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                        default use

                        'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and
                        the unpack

                        methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                        last '/'

                        in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will
                        yield type

                        name "y.z".



                        JSON

                        ====

                        The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the
                        regular

                        representation of the deserialized, embedded message,
                        with an

                        additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                        Example:

                            package google.profile;
                            message Person {
                              string first_name = 1;
                              string last_name = 2;
                            }

                            {
                              "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                              "firstName": <string>,
                              "lastName": <string>
                            }

                        If the embedded message type is well-known and has a
                        custom JSON

                        representation, that representation will be embedded
                        adding a field

                        `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                        `@type`

                        field. Example (for message

                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".



                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                            least

                            one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's
                            path must represent

                            the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                            `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be
                            in a canonical form

                            (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                            In practice, teams usually precompile into the
                            binary all types that they

                            expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                            URLs which use the

                            scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can
                            optionally set up a type

                            server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                            follows:


                            * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                            * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                            [google.protobuf.Type][]
                              value in binary format, or produce an error.
                            * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results
                            based on the
                              URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                              lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                              on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                              breaking changes.)

                            Note: this functionality is not currently available
                            in the official

                            protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                            beginning with

                            type.googleapis.com.


                            Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty
                            scheme) might be

                            used with implementation specific semantics.

                        `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer

                        Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any
                        values in the form

                        of utility functions or additional generated methods of
                        the Any type.


                        Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                            Foo foo = ...;
                            Any any;
                            any.PackFrom(foo);
                            ...
                            if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                              ...
                            }

                        Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                            Foo foo = ...;
                            Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                            ...
                            if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                              foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                            }

                         Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                            foo = Foo(...)
                            any = Any()
                            any.Pack(foo)
                            ...
                            if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                              any.Unpack(foo)
                              ...

                         Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                             foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                             any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                             if err != nil {
                               ...
                             }
                             ...
                             foo := &pb.Foo{}
                             if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                               ...
                             }

                        The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                        default use

                        'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and
                        the unpack

                        methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                        last '/'

                        in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will
                        yield type

                        name "y.z".



                        JSON

                        ====

                        The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the
                        regular

                        representation of the deserialized, embedded message,
                        with an

                        additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                        Example:

                            package google.profile;
                            message Person {
                              string first_name = 1;
                              string last_name = 2;
                            }

                            {
                              "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                              "firstName": <string>,
                              "lastName": <string>
                            }

                        If the embedded message type is well-known and has a
                        custom JSON

                        representation, that representation will be embedded
                        adding a field

                        `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                        `@type`

                        field. Example (for message

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer
                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".



                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
                          "value": "1.212s"

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".



                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
                          "value": "1.212s"
                        }

                        A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of
                        the serialized

                        protocol buffer message. This string must contain at
                        least

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                        must represent

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer
                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".



                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
                          "value": "1.212s"

                        A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of
                        the serialized

                        protocol buffer message. This string must contain at
                        least

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                        must represent

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer
                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".



                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer
                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".



                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
                          "value": "1.212s"

                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".



                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
                          "value": "1.212s"

                            type of the serialized

                            protocol buffer message. This string must contain at
                            least

                            one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's
                            path must represent

                            the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                            `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be
                            in a canonical form

                            (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                            In practice, teams usually precompile into the
                            binary all types that they

                            expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                            URLs which use the

                            scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can
                            optionally set up a type

                            server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                            follows:


                            * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                            * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                            [google.protobuf.Type][]
                              value in binary format, or produce an error.
                            * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results
                            based on the
                              URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                              lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                              on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                              breaking changes.)

                            Note: this functionality is not currently available
                            in the official

                            protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                            beginning with

                            type.googleapis.com.


                            Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty
                            scheme) might be

                            used with implementation specific semantics.

                         Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                             foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                             any, err := anypb.New(foo)

                        The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                        default use

                        'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and
                        the unpack

                        last '/'

                        in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will

                        JSON

                        ====

                        The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the
                        regular

                        representation of the deserialized, embedded message,
                        with an

                        additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                        Example:

                            package google.profile;
                            message Person {
                              string first_name = 1;
                              string last_name = 2;
                            }

                            {
                              "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                              "firstName": <string>,

                            }

                        If the embedded message type is well-known and has a
                        custom JSON

                        representation, that representation will be embedded
                        adding a field

                        `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                        `@type`

                        must represent

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer
                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".



                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
                          "value": "1.212s"
                        }
      parameters:
        - name: pagination.key
          description: |-
            key is a value returned in PageResponse.next_key to begin

            a count of the total number of items available for pagination in
            UIs.

            count_total is only respected when offset is used. It is ignored
            when key

            is set.

                            In practice, teams usually precompile into the

                            URLs which use the

                            scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can
                            optionally set up a type

                            server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                            follows:


                            * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                            * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results
                            based on the

                        Example:

                            package google.profile;
                            message Person {
                              string first_name = 1;
                              string last_name = 2;
                            }

                            {
                              "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                              "firstName": <string>,
                              "lastName": <string>
                            }

                        If the embedded message type is well-known and has a
                        custom JSON

                        representation, that representation will be embedded
                        adding a field

                        `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                        `@type`

                        field. Example (for message

                        A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of
                        the serialized

                        protocol buffer message. This string must contain at
                        least

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                        must represent

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer
                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".



                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage

                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);

                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".



                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".



                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
                          "value": "1.212s"
                        }
      parameters:
        - name: pagination.key
          description: |-
            key is a value returned in PageResponse.next_key to begin

            UIs.

            count_total is only respected when offset is used. It is ignored
            when key

            is set.

                      which use the

                      server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                      follows:


                      * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                      * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a

                        value in binary format, or produce an error.
                      * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                      on the
                        URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                        lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                        on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                        breaking changes.)

                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values

                    `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer
                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".



                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer
                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".



                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                        A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of
                        the serialized

                        protocol buffer message. This string must contain at
                        least

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                        must represent

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer
                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".



                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
                          "value": "1.212s"

                        A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of
                        the serialized

                        protocol buffer message. This string must contain at
                        least

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                        must represent

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer
                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".



                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                        default use

                        'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and
                        the unpack

                        methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                        last '/'

                        in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will
                        yield type

                        name "y.z".



                        JSON

                        ====

                        The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the
                        regular

                        representation of the deserialized, embedded message,
                        with an

                        additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                        Example:

                            package google.profile;
                            message Person {
                              string first_name = 1;
                              string last_name = 2;
                            }

                            {
                              "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                              "firstName": <string>,
                              "lastName": <string>
                            }

                        If the embedded message type is well-known and has a
                        custom JSON

                        representation, that representation will be embedded
                        adding a field

                        `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                        `@type`

                        field. Example (for message
                        [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                            {
                              "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                        the serialized

                        protocol buffer message. This string must contain at
                        least

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                        must represent

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer
                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".



                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                          in a canonical form

                          (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                          In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary

                          expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                          URLs which use the

                          scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can
                          optionally set up a type

                          server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                          follows:


                          * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                          * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                          [google.protobuf.Type][]
                            value in binary format, or produce an error.
                          * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results
                          based on the

                            lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                            on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                            breaking changes.)

                          Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                          the official

                          protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs

                      URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                      Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any
                      values in the form

                      of utility functions or additional generated methods of

                      Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                            ...
                          }

                      Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                          }

                       Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                          foo = Foo(...)

                      JSON

                      ====

                      The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                      representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                      an

                      additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                      Example:

                          package google.profile;
                          message Person {
                            string first_name = 1;
                            string last_name = 2;
                          }

                          {
                            "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",

                            "lastName": <string>
                          }

                      If the embedded message type is well-known and has a
                      custom JSON

                      representation, that representation will be embedded
                      adding a field

                      `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                      `@type`

                      field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                            type of the serialized

                            protocol buffer message. This string must contain at
                            least

                            one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's
                            path must represent

                            the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                            `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be
                            in a canonical form

                            (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                            In practice, teams usually precompile into the
                            binary all types that they

                            expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                            URLs which use the

                            scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can
                            optionally set up a type

                            server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                            follows:


                            * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                            * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                            [google.protobuf.Type][]
                              value in binary format, or produce an error.
                            * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results
                            based on the
                              URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                              lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                              on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                              breaking changes.)

                            Note: this functionality is not currently available
                            in the official

                            protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                            beginning with

                            type.googleapis.com.


                            Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty
                            scheme) might be

                            used with implementation specific semantics.

                        Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any
                        values in the form

                        of utility functions or additional generated methods of

                        Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                              ...
                            }

                        Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                            Foo foo = ...;

                         Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will

                        name "y.z".



                        JSON

                        ====

                        The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the
                        regular

                        representation of the deserialized, embedded message,
                        with an

                        additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                        Example:

                            package google.profile;
                            message Person {
                              string first_name = 1;
                              string last_name = 2;
                            }

                            {
                              "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                              "firstName": <string>,
                              "lastName": <string>
                            }

                        If the embedded message type is well-known and has a
                        custom JSON

                        representation, that representation will be embedded
                        adding a field

                        `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                        `@type`

                        field. Example (for message
                        [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".



                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                          In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                          all types that they

                          expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                          URLs which use the

                          scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can
                          optionally set up a type

                          server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                          follows:


                          * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                          * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                          [google.protobuf.Type][]
                            value in binary format, or produce an error.
                          * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results
                          based on the
                            URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                            lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                            on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                            breaking changes.)

                          Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                          the official

                          protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                          beginning with

                          type.googleapis.com.


                          Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty
                          scheme) might be

                          used with implementation specific semantics.

                      `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer
                      message along with a

                      URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                      Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any
                      values in the form

                      of utility functions or additional generated methods of
                      the Any type.


                      Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                          Foo foo = ...;
                          Any any;
                          any.PackFrom(foo);
                          ...
                          if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                            ...
                          }

                      Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                          Foo foo = ...;
                          Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                          ...
                          if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                            foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                          }

                       Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                          foo = Foo(...)
                          any = Any()
                          any.Pack(foo)
                          ...
                          if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                            any.Unpack(foo)
                            ...

                       Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                           foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                           any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                           if err != nil {
                             ...
                           }
                           ...
                           foo := &pb.Foo{}
                           if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                             ...
                           }

                      The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                      default use

                      'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and
                      the unpack

                      methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                      last '/'

                      in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will
                      yield type

                      name "y.z".



                      JSON

                      ====

                      The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                      representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                      an

                      additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                      Example:

                          package google.profile;
                          message Person {
                            string first_name = 1;
                            string last_name = 2;
                          }

                          {
                            "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",

                            "lastName": <string>
                          }

                      If the embedded message type is well-known and has a
                      custom JSON

                      representation, that representation will be embedded
                      adding a field

                      `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                      `@type`

                      field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                    `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer
                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".



                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                        the serialized

                        protocol buffer message. This string must contain at
                        least

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                        must represent

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer
                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".



                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
                          "value": "1.212s"

                        A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of
                        the serialized

                        protocol buffer message. This string must contain at
                        least

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                        must represent

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer
                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".



                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer
                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".



                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
                          "value": "1.212s"

                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",

                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer
                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".



                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        JSON

                        ====

                        The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the
                        regular

                        representation of the deserialized, embedded message,
                        with an

                        additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                        Example:

                            package google.profile;
                            message Person {
                              string first_name = 1;
                              string last_name = 2;
                            }

                            {

                            }

                        If the embedded message type is well-known and has a
                        custom JSON

                        representation, that representation will be embedded
                        adding a field

                        `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                        `@type`

                        A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of
                        the serialized

                        protocol buffer message. This string must contain at
                        least

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                        must represent

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer
                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".



                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                    `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer
                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".



                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                        the serialized

                        protocol buffer message. This string must contain at
                        least

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                        must represent

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer
                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".



                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
                          "value": "1.212s"

                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values

                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;

                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".



                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                          expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                          URLs which use the

                          scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can
                          optionally set up a type

                          server that maps type URLs to message definitions as

                          * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                          * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);

                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".



                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                        protocol buffer message. This string must contain at

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer
                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);

                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".



                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
                          "value": "1.212s"

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                        A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of
                        the serialized

                        protocol buffer message. This string must contain at
                        least

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                        must represent

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer
                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        }

                        {

                        protocol buffer message. This string must contain at
                        least

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                        must represent

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer
                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".



                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".



                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                        the serialized

                        protocol buffer message. This string must contain at
                        least

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                        must represent

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer
                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);

                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)

                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}

                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a

                        on the

                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        might be

                    `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer
                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".



                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
                          "value": "1.212s"

                        A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of
                        the serialized

                        protocol buffer message. This string must contain at

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a

                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                    `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer
                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".



                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".



                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer
                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".



                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer
                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".



                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",

                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                        A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of
                        the serialized

                        protocol buffer message. This string must contain at
                        least

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                        must represent

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                  description: >-
                    `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer
                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".



                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);

                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);

                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".



                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".



                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
                          "value": "1.212s"

                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".



                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
                          "value": "1.212s"

            UIs.

            count_total is only respected when offset is used. It is ignored

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path

                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.

                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".



                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
                          "value": "1.212s"

                          protocol buffer message. This string must contain at
                          least

                          one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                          must represent

                          the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                          `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be
                          in a canonical form

                          (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                          In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                          all types that they

                          expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                          URLs which use the

                          scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can
                          optionally set up a type

                          server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                          follows:


                          * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                          * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                          [google.protobuf.Type][]
                            value in binary format, or produce an error.
                          * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results
                          based on the
                            URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                            lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                            on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                            breaking changes.)

                          Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                          the official

                          protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                          beginning with

                          type.googleapis.com.


                          Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty
                          scheme) might be

                          used with implementation specific semantics.

                      Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any
                      values in the form

                      of utility functions or additional generated methods of
                      the Any type.


                      Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                          Foo foo = ...;
                          Any any;

                            ...

                      Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                          if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                            foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                          }

                       Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                       Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                           foo := &pb.Foo{...}

                      The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                      default use

                      last '/'

                      in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will

                      ====

                      The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                      representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                      an

                      additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                      Example:

                          package google.profile;
                          message Person {

                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".



                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
                          "value": "1.212s"
                        }
      parameters:

                      A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of
                      the serialized

                      protocol buffer message. This string must contain at least

                      one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path must
                      represent

                      the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                      `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in a
                      canonical form

                      (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                      In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary all
                      types that they

                      expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for URLs
                      which use the

                      scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                      set up a type

                      server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                      follows:


                      * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                      * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                      [google.protobuf.Type][]
                        value in binary format, or produce an error.
                      * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                      on the
                        URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                        lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                        on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                        breaking changes.)

                      Note: this functionality is not currently available in the
                      official

                      protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                      beginning with

                      type.googleapis.com.


                      Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                      might be

                      used with implementation specific semantics.

                       }

                  The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default
                  use

                  'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                  unpack

                  methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last
                  '/'

                  in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                  type

                  name "y.z".

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer
                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".



                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                        protocol buffer message. This string must contain at
                        least

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                        must represent

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;

                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                        A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of
                        the serialized

                        protocol buffer message. This string must contain at
                        least

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                        must represent

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer
                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".



                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a

                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs

                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)

                    `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer
                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".



                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);

                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)

                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}

                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".



                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        the serialized

                        protocol buffer message. This string must contain at
                        least

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                        must represent

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer
                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".



                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                    `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer
                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".



                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
                          "value": "1.212s"

                        the serialized

                        protocol buffer message. This string must contain at
                        least

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                        must represent

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs

                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of
                        the serialized

                        protocol buffer message. This string must contain at
                        least

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                        must represent

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer
                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".



                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                            scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can
                            optionally set up a type

                            follows:


                            * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                            * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                            [google.protobuf.Type][]
                              value in binary format, or produce an error.
                            * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results
                            based on the

                              lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                              on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                              breaking changes.)

                            Note: this functionality is not currently available
                            in the official

                            protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs

                        Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any
                        values in the form

                        of utility functions or additional generated methods of
                        the Any type.


                        Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                            Foo foo = ...;

                              ...
                            }

                        Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                            Foo foo = ...;
                            Any any = Any.pack(foo);

                            if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                              foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                            }

                         Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                            foo = Foo(...)
                            any = Any()
                            any.Pack(foo)
                            ...
                            if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                              any.Unpack(foo)
                              ...

                         Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                             foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                             any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                             if err != nil {
                               ...

                             foo := &pb.Foo{}

                             }

                        The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                        default use

                        'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and
                        the unpack

                        methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                        last '/'

                        in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will
                        yield type

                        name "y.z".



                        JSON

                        ====

                        The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the
                        regular

                        representation of the deserialized, embedded message,
                        with an

                        additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                        Example:

                            package google.profile;
                            message Person {
                              string first_name = 1;
                              string last_name = 2;
                            }

                            {
                              "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",

                            }

                        If the embedded message type is well-known and has a
                        custom JSON

                        representation, that representation will be embedded
                        adding a field

                        `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                        `@type`

                        field. Example (for message

                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".



                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
                          "value": "1.212s"
                        }
      parameters:
        - name: pagination.key
          description: |-
            key is a value returned in PageResponse.next_key to begin

            UIs.

            count_total is only respected when offset is used. It is ignored

                      one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path must
                      represent

                      the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                      (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                      In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary all
                      types that they

                      expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for URLs
                      which use the

                      scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                      set up a type

                      server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                      follows:


                      * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                      * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                      [google.protobuf.Type][]
                        value in binary format, or produce an error.
                      * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                      on the
                        URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                        lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                        on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                        breaking changes.)

                      Note: this functionality is not currently available in the
                      official

                      protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                      beginning with

                      type.googleapis.com.


                      Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                      might be

                      used with implementation specific semantics.

                  `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer message
                  along with a

                  URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                  Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values in
                  the form

                  of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                  Any type.


                  Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                      Foo foo = ...;
                      Any any;
                      any.PackFrom(foo);

                      }

                  Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                      Foo foo = ...;
                      Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                      ...
                      if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                        foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                      }

                   Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                      foo = Foo(...)
                      any = Any()
                      any.Pack(foo)
                      ...
                      if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                        any.Unpack(foo)
                        ...

                   Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                       foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                       any, err := anypb.New(foo)

                       foo := &pb.Foo{}
                       if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                         ...
                       }

                  The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default
                  use

                  'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                  unpack

                  methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last
                  '/'

                  in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                  type

                  name "y.z".

                  ====

                  The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                  representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an

                  additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example:

                      package google.profile;
                      message Person {
                        string first_name = 1;
                        string last_name = 2;
                      }

                  `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type`

                    `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer
                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".



                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                        A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of
                        the serialized

                        protocol buffer message. This string must contain at
                        least

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                        must represent

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs

                            scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can
                            optionally set up a type

                            follows:


                            * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                            * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                            [google.protobuf.Type][]
                              value in binary format, or produce an error.
                            * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results
                            based on the

                              lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                              on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                              breaking changes.)

                            Note: this functionality is not currently available
                            in the official

                        Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any
                        values in the form

                        of utility functions or additional generated methods of
                        the Any type.


                        Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                            Foo foo = ...;

                              ...
                            }

                        Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                            Foo foo = ...;
                            Any any = Any.pack(foo);

                            }

                         Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                            if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                              any.Unpack(foo)

                         Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                             foo := &pb.Foo{...}

                        the unpack

                        methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                        last '/'

                        in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will
                        yield type

                        name "y.z".



                        JSON

                        ====

                        The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the
                        regular

                        representation of the deserialized, embedded message,
                        with an

                        additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                        Example:

                            package google.profile;
                            message Person {
                              string first_name = 1;
                              string last_name = 2;
                            }

                            {
                              "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",

                            }

                        If the embedded message type is well-known and has a
                        custom JSON

                        representation, that representation will be embedded
                        adding a field

                        `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                        `@type`

                        field. Example (for message

                    type

                    name "y.z".



                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer
                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".



                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                      A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of
                      the serialized

                      protocol buffer message. This string must contain at least

                      one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path must
                      represent

                      the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                      canonical form

                      (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                      In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary all
                      types that they

                      expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for URLs
                      which use the

                      scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                      set up a type

                      server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                      follows:


                      * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                      * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                      [google.protobuf.Type][]
                        value in binary format, or produce an error.
                      * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                      on the
                        URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                        lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                        on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                        breaking changes.)

                      Note: this functionality is not currently available in the
                      official

                      protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                      beginning with

                      type.googleapis.com.


                      Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                      might be

                      used with implementation specific semantics.

                  `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer message
                  along with a

                  URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                  Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values in
                  the form

                  of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                  Any type.


                  Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                      Foo foo = ...;
                      Any any;
                      any.PackFrom(foo);

                        ...
                      }

                  Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                      Foo foo = ...;
                      Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                      ...
                      if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                        foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                      }

                   Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                      foo = Foo(...)
                      any = Any()
                      any.Pack(foo)
                      ...
                      if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                        any.Unpack(foo)
                        ...

                   Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                       foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                       any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                       if err != nil {
                         ...
                       }
                       ...
                       foo := &pb.Foo{}
                       if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                         ...
                       }

                  The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default
                  use

                  'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                  unpack

                  methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last
                  '/'

                  in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                  type

                  name "y.z".



                  JSON

                  ====

                  The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                  representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an

                  additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example:

                      package google.profile;
                      message Person {
                        string first_name = 1;
                        string last_name = 2;
                      }

                      {
                        "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                        "firstName": <string>,
                        "lastName": <string>
                      }

                  If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                  JSON

                  representation, that representation will be embedded adding a
                  field

                  `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type`

                  field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                      {
                        "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                  state-machine

                  breaking changes In these cases, the RevisionNumber is
                  incremented so that

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.

                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        might be

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);

                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                  'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                  unpack

                  methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last
                  '/'

                  in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                  type

                  name "y.z".



                  JSON

                  ====

                  The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                  representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an

                  additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example:

                      package google.profile;
                      message Person {
                        string first_name = 1;
                        string last_name = 2;
                      }

                      {
                        "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                        "firstName": <string>,
                        "lastName": <string>
                      }

                  If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                  JSON

                  representation, that representation will be embedded adding a
                  field

                  `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type`

                  field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                      {
                        "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a

                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs

                        might be

                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);

                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}

                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".



                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                        protocol buffer message. This string must contain at
                        least

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                        must represent

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer
                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)

                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}

                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".



                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
                          "value": "1.212s"
                        }

                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer
                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                          A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type
                          of the serialized

                          protocol buffer message. This string must contain at
                          least

                          one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                          must represent

                          the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                          `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be
                          in a canonical form

                          (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                          In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                          all types that they

                          expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                          URLs which use the

                          scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can
                          optionally set up a type

                          server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                          follows:


                          * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                          * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                          [google.protobuf.Type][]
                            value in binary format, or produce an error.
                          * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results
                          based on the
                            URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                            lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                            on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                            breaking changes.)

                          Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                          the official

                          protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                          beginning with

                          type.googleapis.com.


                          Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty
                          scheme) might be

                          used with implementation specific semantics.

                      Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any
                      values in the form

                      of utility functions or additional generated methods of
                      the Any type.


                      Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                          Foo foo = ...;

                            ...
                          }

                      Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                          Foo foo = ...;
                          Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                          ...
                          if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                            foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                          }

                       Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                          foo = Foo(...)

                          any.Pack(foo)

                          if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                            any.Unpack(foo)
                            ...

                       Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                           foo := &pb.Foo{...}

                           if err != nil {
                             ...
                           }

                             ...
                           }

                      The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                      default use

                      'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and
                      the unpack

                      methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                      last '/'

                      in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will
                      yield type

                      name "y.z".

                      an

                      additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                      Example:

                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)

                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".



                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
                          "value": "1.212s"
                        }
      parameters:

                      A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of
                      the serialized

                      protocol buffer message. This string must contain at least

                      one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path must
                      represent

                      the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                      `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in a
                      canonical form

                      (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                      In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary all
                      types that they

                      expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for URLs
                      which use the

                      scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                      set up a type

                      server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                      follows:


                      * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                      * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                      [google.protobuf.Type][]
                        value in binary format, or produce an error.
                      * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                      on the
                        URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                        lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                        on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                        breaking changes.)

                      Note: this functionality is not currently available in the
                      official

                      protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                      beginning with

                      type.googleapis.com.


                      Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                      might be

                      used with implementation specific semantics.

                  Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values in
                  the form

                  of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                  Any type.

                      Foo foo = ...;

                  The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default

                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".



                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
                          "value": "1.212s"

                        protocol buffer message. This string must contain at
                        least

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                        must represent

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer
                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".



                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                        A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of
                        the serialized

                        protocol buffer message. This string must contain at
                        least

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                        must represent

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer
                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".



                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                    `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer
                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".



                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
                          "value": "1.212s"

                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer
                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".



                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;

                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding

                        A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of
                        the serialized

                        protocol buffer message. This string must contain at
                        least

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                        must represent

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer
                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".



                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                            for a given proof type.

                            This can be stored in the client and used to
                            validate any incoming proofs.

                            As demonstrated in tests, if we don't fix the
                            algorithm used to calculate the

                            LeafHash for a given tree, there are many possible
                            key-value pairs that can

                            generate a given hash (by interpretting the preimage
                            differently).

                            We need this for proper security, requires client
                            knows a priori what

                            tree format server uses. But not in code, rather a

                        A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of
                        the serialized

                        protocol buffer message. This string must contain at
                        least

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                        must represent

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer
                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".



                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally

                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage

                        beginning with

                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer
                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".



                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
                          "value": "1.212s"
                        }
      parameters:

                        protocol buffer message. This string must contain at
                        least

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                        must represent

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer
                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".



                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer
                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".



                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                        protocol buffer message. This string must contain at

                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer
                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".



                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in

                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer
                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".



                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                        the serialized

                        protocol buffer message. This string must contain at
                        least

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                        must represent

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.

                        on the

                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved

                        A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of
                        the serialized

                        protocol buffer message. This string must contain at
                        least

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                        must represent

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
                          "value": "1.212s"

                                  nessecary data

                              at least

                              one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's
                              path must represent

                              the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                              `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should
                              be in a canonical form

                              (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                              In practice, teams usually precompile into the
                              binary all types that they

                              expect it to use in the context of Any. However,
                              for URLs which use the

                              scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can
                              optionally set up a type

                              server that maps type URLs to message definitions
                              as follows:


                              * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                              * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                              [google.protobuf.Type][]
                                value in binary format, or produce an error.
                              * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results
                              based on the
                                URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                                lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                                on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                                breaking changes.)

                              Note: this functionality is not currently
                              available in the official

                              protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                              beginning with

                              type.googleapis.com.


                              Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty
                              scheme) might be

                              used with implementation specific semantics.

                          `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer
                          message along with a

                          URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                          Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any
                          values in the form

                          of utility functions or additional generated methods
                          of the Any type.


                          Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                              Foo foo = ...;
                              Any any;
                              any.PackFrom(foo);
                              ...
                              if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                                ...
                              }

                          Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                              Foo foo = ...;
                              Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                              ...
                              if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                                foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                              }

                           Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                              foo = Foo(...)
                              any = Any()
                              any.Pack(foo)
                              ...
                              if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                                any.Unpack(foo)
                                ...

                           Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                               foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                               any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                               if err != nil {
                                 ...
                               }
                               ...
                               foo := &pb.Foo{}
                               if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                                 ...
                               }

                          The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                          default use

                          'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL
                          and the unpack

                          methods only use the fully qualified type name after
                          the last '/'

                          in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will
                          yield type

                          name "y.z".



                          JSON

                          ====

                          The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the
                          regular

                          representation of the deserialized, embedded message,
                          with an

                          additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                          Example:

                              package google.profile;
                              message Person {
                                string first_name = 1;
                                string last_name = 2;
                              }

                              {
                                "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                                "firstName": <string>,

                              }

                          If the embedded message type is well-known and has a
                          custom JSON

                          representation, that representation will be embedded
                          adding a field

                              as follows:


                              * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                              * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                              [google.protobuf.Type][]
                                value in binary format, or produce an error.
                              * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results
                              based on the
                                URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                                lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                                on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                                breaking changes.)

                              Note: this functionality is not currently
                              available in the official

                              protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                              beginning with

                              type.googleapis.com.


                              Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty
                              scheme) might be

                              used with implementation specific semantics.

                          `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer
                          message along with a

                          URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                          Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any
                          values in the form

                          of utility functions or additional generated methods
                          of the Any type.


                          Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                              Foo foo = ...;
                              Any any;
                              any.PackFrom(foo);
                              ...
                              if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                                ...
                              }

                          Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                              Foo foo = ...;
                              Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                              ...
                              if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                                foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                              }

                           Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                              foo = Foo(...)
                              any = Any()
                              any.Pack(foo)
                              ...
                              if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                                any.Unpack(foo)
                                ...

                           Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                               foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                               any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                               if err != nil {
                                 ...
                               }
                               ...
                               foo := &pb.Foo{}
                               if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                                 ...
                               }

                          The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                          default use

                          'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL
                          and the unpack

                          methods only use the fully qualified type name after
                          the last '/'

                          in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will
                          yield type

                          name "y.z".



                          JSON

                          ====

                          The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the
                          regular

                          representation of the deserialized, embedded message,
                          with an

                          additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                          Example:

                              package google.profile;
                              message Person {
                                string first_name = 1;
                                string last_name = 2;
                              }

                              {
                                "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                                "firstName": <string>,
                                "lastName": <string>
                              }

                          If the embedded message type is well-known and has a
                          custom JSON

                          representation, that representation will be embedded
                          adding a field

                          `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                          `@type`

                          field. Example (for message
                          [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                              {

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                        must represent

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer
                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".



                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
                          "value": "1.212s"

                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer
                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".



                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                        A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of

                        protocol buffer message. This string must contain at
                        least

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                        must represent

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs

                    `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer
                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".



                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
                          "value": "1.212s"
                        }
      parameters:
        - name: query_id

                      type: string
                      description: >-
                        A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of
                        the serialized

                        protocol buffer message. This string must contain at
                        least

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                        must represent

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a

                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);

                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)

                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".



                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".



                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
                          "value": "1.212s"
                        }
      parameters:
        - name: pagination.key
          description: |-
            key is a value returned in PageResponse.next_key to begin

            It is less efficient than using key. Only one of offset or key

            be set.

          in: query
          required: false

            a count of the total number of items available for pagination in
            UIs.

            count_total is only respected when offset is used. It is ignored
            when key

            is set.
          in: query
          required: false
          type: boolean
        - name: pagination.reverse

                        protocol buffer message. This string must contain at
                        least

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                        must represent

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                  description: >-
                    `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer
                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".

                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer
                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                         if err != nil {
                           ...
                         }
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".



                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
                          "value": "1.212s"

                    types that they

                    server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                    follows:


                    * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                    * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                    [google.protobuf.Type][]
                      value in binary format, or produce an error.
                    * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on
                    the
                      URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                      lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                      on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                      breaking changes.)

                      ...
                      if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                        any.Unpack(foo)
                        ...

                   Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                       foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                       any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                       if err != nil {
                         ...
                       }
                       ...
                       foo := &pb.Foo{}
                       if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                         ...
                       }

                  The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default
                  use

                  'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                  unpack

                  methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last
                  '/'

                  in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                  type

                  name "y.z".



                  JSON

                  ====

                  The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                  representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an

                  additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example:

                      package google.profile;
                      message Person {
                        string first_name = 1;
                        string last_name = 2;
                      }

                      {
                        "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                        "firstName": <string>,
                        "lastName": <string>
                      }

                  If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                  JSON

                  representation, that representation will be embedded adding a
                  field

                  `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type`

                  field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                      {
                        "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of the

                protocol buffer message. This string must contain at least

                one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path must
                represent

                the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in a
                canonical form

                (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary all types
                that they

                expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for URLs which
                use the

                scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally set up
                a type

                server that maps type URLs to message definitions as follows:


                * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a [google.protobuf.Type][]
                  value in binary format, or produce an error.
                * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on the
                  URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                  lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                  on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                  breaking changes.)

                Note: this functionality is not currently available in the
                official

                protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning
                with

                type.googleapis.com.


                Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme) might
                be

                used with implementation specific semantics.

            `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer message along
            with a

            URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


            Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values in the
            form

            of utility functions or additional generated methods of the Any
            type.


            Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                Foo foo = ...;
                Any any;
                any.PackFrom(foo);
                ...
                if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                  ...
                }

            Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                Foo foo = ...;
                Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                ...
                if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                  foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                }

             Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                foo = Foo(...)
                any = Any()
                any.Pack(foo)
                ...
                if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                  any.Unpack(foo)
                  ...

             Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                 foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                 any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                 if err != nil {
                   ...
                 }
                 ...
                 foo := &pb.Foo{}
                 if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                   ...
                 }

            The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default use

            'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the unpack

            methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last '/'

            in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield type

            name "y.z".



            JSON

            ====

            The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

            representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an

            additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example:

                package google.profile;
                message Person {
                  string first_name = 1;
                  string last_name = 2;
                }

                {
                  "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                  "firstName": <string>,
                  "lastName": <string>
                }

            If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON

            representation, that representation will be embedded adding a field

            `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type`

            field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                {
                  "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

              server that maps type URLs to message definitions as follows:


              * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

              * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on the
                URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage

              type.googleapis.com.


              Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme) might be

      `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer message along with
      a

      URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


      Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values in the form

      of utility functions or additional generated methods of the Any type.


      Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

          Foo foo = ...;
          Any any;
          any.PackFrom(foo);
          ...
          if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
            ...
          }

      Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

          Foo foo = ...;
          Any any = Any.pack(foo);
          ...
          if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
            foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
          }

       Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

          foo = Foo(...)
          any = Any()
          any.Pack(foo)
          ...
          if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
            any.Unpack(foo)
            ...

       Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

           foo := &pb.Foo{...}
           any, err := anypb.New(foo)
           if err != nil {
             ...
           }
           ...
           foo := &pb.Foo{}
           if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
             ...
           }

      The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default use

      'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the unpack

      methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last '/'

      in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield type

      name "y.z".



      JSON

      ====

      The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

      representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an

      additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example:

          package google.profile;
          message Person {
            string first_name = 1;
            string last_name = 2;
          }

          {
            "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
            "firstName": <string>,
            "lastName": <string>
          }

      If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON

      representation, that representation will be embedded adding a field

      `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type`

      field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

          {
            "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
            "value": "1.212s"

          `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer message along
          with a

          URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


          Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values in the
          form

          of utility functions or additional generated methods of the Any type.


          Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

              Foo foo = ...;
              Any any;
              any.PackFrom(foo);
              ...
              if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                ...
              }

          Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

              Foo foo = ...;
              Any any = Any.pack(foo);
              ...
              if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
              }

           Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

              foo = Foo(...)
              any = Any()
              any.Pack(foo)
              ...
              if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                any.Unpack(foo)
                ...

           Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

               foo := &pb.Foo{...}
               any, err := anypb.New(foo)
               if err != nil {
                 ...
               }
               ...
               foo := &pb.Foo{}
               if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                 ...
               }

          The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default use

          'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the unpack

          methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last '/'

          in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield type

          name "y.z".



          JSON

          ====

          The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

          representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an

          additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example:

              package google.profile;
              message Person {
                string first_name = 1;
                string last_name = 2;
              }

              {
                "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                "firstName": <string>,
                "lastName": <string>
              }

          If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON

          representation, that representation will be embedded adding a field

          `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type`

          field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

              {
                "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
                "value": "1.212s"

                  one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path must
                  represent

                  the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                  `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in a
                  canonical form

                  (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                  In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary all
                  types that they

                  expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for URLs
                  which use the

                  scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally set
                  up a type

                  server that maps type URLs to message definitions as follows:


                  * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                  * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a [google.protobuf.Type][]
                    value in binary format, or produce an error.
                  * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on
                  the
                    URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                    lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                    on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                    breaking changes.)

                  Note: this functionality is not currently available in the
                  official

                  protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning
                  with

                  type.googleapis.com.


                  Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme) might

                a type

                server that maps type URLs to message definitions as follows:


                * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a [google.protobuf.Type][]
                  value in binary format, or produce an error.
                * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on the
                  URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                  lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                  on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                  breaking changes.)

                Note: this functionality is not currently available in the
                official

                protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning
                with

                type.googleapis.com.

            `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer message along
            with a

            URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


            Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values in the
            form

            of utility functions or additional generated methods of the Any
            type.


            Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                Foo foo = ...;
                Any any;
                any.PackFrom(foo);
                ...
                if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                  ...
                }

            Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                Foo foo = ...;
                Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                ...
                if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                  foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                }

             Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                foo = Foo(...)
                any = Any()
                any.Pack(foo)
                ...
                if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                  any.Unpack(foo)
                  ...

             Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                 foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                 any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                 if err != nil {
                   ...
                 }
                 ...
                 foo := &pb.Foo{}
                 if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                   ...
                 }

            The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default use

            'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the unpack

            methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last '/'

            in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield type

            name "y.z".



            JSON

            ====

            The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

            representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an

            additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example:

                package google.profile;
                message Person {
                  string first_name = 1;
                  string last_name = 2;
                }

                {
                  "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                  "firstName": <string>,
                  "lastName": <string>
                }

            If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON

            representation, that representation will be embedded adding a field

            `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type`

            field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                {
                  "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
                  "value": "1.212s"

              In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary all types
              that they

              expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for URLs which
              use the

              type

              server that maps type URLs to message definitions as follows:


              * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

              * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a [google.protobuf.Type][]
                value in binary format, or produce an error.
              * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on the
                URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage

              Note: this functionality is not currently available in the
              official

              protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning with

              type.googleapis.com.

          `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer message along
          with a

          URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


          Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values in the
          form

          of utility functions or additional generated methods of the Any type.


          Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

              Foo foo = ...;
              Any any;
              any.PackFrom(foo);
              ...
              if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                ...
              }

          Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

              Foo foo = ...;
              Any any = Any.pack(foo);
              ...
              if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
              }

           Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

              foo = Foo(...)
              any = Any()
              any.Pack(foo)
              ...
              if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                any.Unpack(foo)
                ...

           Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

               foo := &pb.Foo{...}
               any, err := anypb.New(foo)
               if err != nil {
                 ...
               }
               ...
               foo := &pb.Foo{}
               if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                 ...
               }

          The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default use

          'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the unpack

          methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last '/'

          in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield type

          name "y.z".



          JSON

          ====

          The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

          representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an

          additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example:

              package google.profile;
              message Person {
                string first_name = 1;
                string last_name = 2;
              }

              {
                "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                "firstName": <string>,
                "lastName": <string>
              }

          If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON

          representation, that representation will be embedded adding a field

          `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type`

          field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

              {
                "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
                "value": "1.212s"

                 Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                     foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                     any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                     if err != nil {
                       ...
                     }
                     ...
                     foo := &pb.Foo{}
                     if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                       ...
                     }

                The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default
                use

                'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                unpack

                methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last
                '/'

                in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield type

                name "y.z".



                JSON

                ====

                The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an

                additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example:

                    package google.profile;
                    message Person {
                      string first_name = 1;
                      string last_name = 2;
                    }

                    {
                      "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                      "firstName": <string>,
                      "lastName": <string>
                    }

                If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON

                representation, that representation will be embedded adding a
                field

                `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type`

                field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                    {
                      "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                    A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of the

                    protocol buffer message. This string must contain at least

                    one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path must
                    represent

                    the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                    `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in a
                    canonical form

                    (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                    In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary all
                    types that they

                    expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for URLs
                    which use the

                    scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally set
                    up a type

                    server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                    follows:


                    * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                    * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                    [google.protobuf.Type][]
                      value in binary format, or produce an error.
                    * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on
                    the
                      URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                      lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                      on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                      breaking changes.)

                    Note: this functionality is not currently available in the
                    official

                    protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning
                    with

                    type.googleapis.com.


                    Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                    might be

                representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an

                additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example:

                    package google.profile;
                    message Person {
                      string first_name = 1;
                      string last_name = 2;
                    }

                    {
                      "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                      "firstName": <string>,
                      "lastName": <string>
                    }

                If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON

                representation, that representation will be embedded adding a
                field

                `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type`

                field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                    {
                      "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                  proposer_address is the original block proposer address,
                  formatted as a Bech32 string.

                  In Tendermint, this type is `bytes`, but in the SDK, we
                  convert it to a Bech32 string

                  for better UX.

                    protocol buffer message. This string must contain at least

                    one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path must
                    represent

                    the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                    `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in a
                    canonical form

                    (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                    In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary all
                    types that they

                    expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for URLs
                    which use the

                    scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally set
                    up a type

                    server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                    follows:


                    * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                    * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                    [google.protobuf.Type][]
                      value in binary format, or produce an error.
                    * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on
                    the
                      URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                      lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                      on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                      breaking changes.)

                    Note: this functionality is not currently available in the
                    official

                    protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning
                    with

                    type.googleapis.com.


                    Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                    might be

                    used with implementation specific semantics.

                along with a

                URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values in
                the form

                of utility functions or additional generated methods of the Any
                type.


                Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                    Foo foo = ...;
                    Any any;
                    any.PackFrom(foo);
                    ...
                    if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                      ...
                    }

                Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                    Foo foo = ...;
                    Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                    ...
                    if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                      foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                    }

                 Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                    foo = Foo(...)
                    any = Any()
                    any.Pack(foo)
                    ...
                    if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                      any.Unpack(foo)
                      ...

                 Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                     foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                     any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                     if err != nil {
                       ...
                     }
                     ...
                     foo := &pb.Foo{}
                     if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                       ...
                     }

                The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default
                use

                'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                unpack

                methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last
                '/'

                in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield type

                name "y.z".



                JSON

                ====

                The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an

                additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example:

                    package google.profile;
                    message Person {
                      string first_name = 1;
                      string last_name = 2;
                    }

                    {
                      "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                      "firstName": <string>,
                      "lastName": <string>
                    }

                If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON

                representation, that representation will be embedded adding a
                field

                `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type`

                field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                    {
                      "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                    any = Any()
                    any.Pack(foo)
                    ...
                    if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                      any.Unpack(foo)
                      ...

                 Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                     foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                     any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                     if err != nil {
                       ...
                     }
                     ...
                     foo := &pb.Foo{}
                     if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                       ...
                     }

                The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default
                use

                'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                unpack

                methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last
                '/'

                in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield type

                name "y.z".



                JSON

                ====

                The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an

                additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example:

                    package google.profile;
                    message Person {
                      string first_name = 1;
                      string last_name = 2;
                    }

                    {
                      "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                      "firstName": <string>,
                      "lastName": <string>
                    }

                If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON

                representation, that representation will be embedded adding a
                field

                `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type`

                field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                    {
                      "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
                      "value": "1.212s"

              the fully qualified name of the type (as in

              In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary all types
              that they

              expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for URLs which
              use the

              scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally set up a
              type

              server that maps type URLs to message definitions as follows:


              * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

              * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a [google.protobuf.Type][]
                value in binary format, or produce an error.
              * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on the
                URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                breaking changes.)

              Note: this functionality is not currently available in the
              official

              protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning with

              type.googleapis.com.


              Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme) might be

              used with implementation specific semantics.

        description: >-
          `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer message along
          with a

          URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


          Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values in the
          form

          of utility functions or additional generated methods of the Any type.


          Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

              Foo foo = ...;
              Any any;
              any.PackFrom(foo);
              ...
              if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                ...
              }

          Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

              Foo foo = ...;
              Any any = Any.pack(foo);
              ...
              if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
              }

           Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

              foo = Foo(...)
              any = Any()
              any.Pack(foo)
              ...
              if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                any.Unpack(foo)
                ...

           Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

               foo := &pb.Foo{...}
               any, err := anypb.New(foo)
               if err != nil {
                 ...
               }
               ...
               foo := &pb.Foo{}
               if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                 ...
               }

          The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default use

          'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the unpack

          methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last '/'

          in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield type

          name "y.z".



          JSON

          ====

          The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

          representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an

          additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example:

              package google.profile;
              message Person {
                string first_name = 1;
                string last_name = 2;
              }

              {
                "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                "firstName": <string>,
                "lastName": <string>
              }

          If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON

          representation, that representation will be embedded adding a field

          `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type`

          field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

              {
                "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
                "value": "1.212s"
              }

                a type

                server that maps type URLs to message definitions as follows:


                * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a [google.protobuf.Type][]
                  value in binary format, or produce an error.
                * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on the
                  URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                  lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                  on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                  breaking changes.)

                Note: this functionality is not currently available in the
                official

                protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning
                with

                type.googleapis.com.


                Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme) might
                be

                used with implementation specific semantics.

            `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer message along
            with a

            URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


            Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values in the
            form

            of utility functions or additional generated methods of the Any
            type.


            Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                Foo foo = ...;
                Any any;
                any.PackFrom(foo);
                ...
                if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                  ...
                }

            Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                Foo foo = ...;
                Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                ...
                if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                  foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                }

             Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                foo = Foo(...)
                any = Any()
                any.Pack(foo)
                ...
                if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                  any.Unpack(foo)
                  ...

             Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                 foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                 any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                 if err != nil {
                   ...
                 }
                 ...
                 foo := &pb.Foo{}
                 if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                   ...
                 }

            The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default use

            'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the unpack

            methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last '/'

            in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield type

            name "y.z".



            JSON

            ====

            The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

            representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an

            additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example:

                package google.profile;
                message Person {
                  string first_name = 1;
                  string last_name = 2;
                }

                {
                  "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                  "firstName": <string>,
                  "lastName": <string>
                }

            If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON

            representation, that representation will be embedded adding a field

            `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type`

            field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                {
                  "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

              server that maps type URLs to message definitions as follows:


              * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

              * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a [google.protobuf.Type][]
                value in binary format, or produce an error.
              * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on the
                URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved

          `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer message along
          with a

          URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


          Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values in the
          form

          of utility functions or additional generated methods of the Any type.


          Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

              Foo foo = ...;
              Any any;
              any.PackFrom(foo);
              ...
              if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                ...
              }

          Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

              Foo foo = ...;
              Any any = Any.pack(foo);
              ...
              if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
              }

           Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

              foo = Foo(...)
              any = Any()
              any.Pack(foo)
              ...
              if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                any.Unpack(foo)
                ...

           Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

               foo := &pb.Foo{...}
               any, err := anypb.New(foo)
               if err != nil {
                 ...

                 ...
               }

          The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default use

          'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the unpack

          methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last '/'

          in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield type

          name "y.z".



          JSON

          ====

          The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

          representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an

          additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example:

              package google.profile;
              message Person {
                string first_name = 1;
                string last_name = 2;
              }

              {
                "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                "firstName": <string>,
                "lastName": <string>
              }

          If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON

          representation, that representation will be embedded adding a field

          `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type`

          field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

              {
                "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
                "value": "1.212s"

                    scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally set
                    up a type

                    server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                    follows:


                    * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                    * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                    [google.protobuf.Type][]
                      value in binary format, or produce an error.
                    * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on
                    the
                      URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                      lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                      on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                      breaking changes.)

                    Note: this functionality is not currently available in the
                    official

                    protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning
                    with

                    type.googleapis.com.


                    Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                    might be

                    used with implementation specific semantics.

                along with a

                URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values in
                the form

                of utility functions or additional generated methods of the Any
                type.


                Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                    Foo foo = ...;
                    Any any;
                    any.PackFrom(foo);

                      ...

                Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                    Foo foo = ...;
                    Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                    ...
                    if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                      foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                    }

                 Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                    foo = Foo(...)
                    any = Any()
                    any.Pack(foo)
                    ...
                    if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                      any.Unpack(foo)
                      ...

                 Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                     foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                     any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                     if err != nil {

                       ...
                     }

                The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default
                use

                'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                unpack

                methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last
                '/'

                in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield type

                name "y.z".



                JSON

                representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an

                additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example:

                    package google.profile;
                    message Person {
                      string first_name = 1;
                      string last_name = 2;
                    }

                    {
                      "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",

                    A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of the
                    serialized

                    protocol buffer message. This string must contain at least

                    one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path must
                    represent

                    the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                    `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in a
                    canonical form

                    (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                    In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary all
                    types that they

                    expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for URLs
                    which use the

                    scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally set
                    up a type

                    server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                    follows:


                    * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                    * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                    [google.protobuf.Type][]
                      value in binary format, or produce an error.
                    * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on
                    the
                      URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                      lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                      on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                      breaking changes.)

                    Note: this functionality is not currently available in the
                    official

                    protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning
                    with

                    type.googleapis.com.


                    Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                    might be

                    used with implementation specific semantics.

                `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer message
                along with a

                URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values in
                the form

                of utility functions or additional generated methods of the Any
                type.


                Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                    Foo foo = ...;
                    Any any;
                    any.PackFrom(foo);
                    ...
                    if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                      ...
                    }

                Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                    Foo foo = ...;
                    Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                    ...
                    if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                      foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                    }

                 Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                    foo = Foo(...)
                    any = Any()
                    any.Pack(foo)
                    ...
                    if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                      any.Unpack(foo)
                      ...

                 Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                     foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                     any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                     if err != nil {
                       ...
                     }
                     ...
                     foo := &pb.Foo{}
                     if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                       ...
                     }

                The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default
                use

                'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                unpack

                methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last
                '/'

                in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield type

                name "y.z".



                JSON

                ====

                The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an

                additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example:

                    package google.profile;
                    message Person {
                      string first_name = 1;
                      string last_name = 2;
                    }

                    {
                      "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                      "firstName": <string>,
                      "lastName": <string>
                    }

                If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON

                representation, that representation will be embedded adding a
                field

                `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type`

                field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                    {
                      "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
                      "value": "1.212s"
                    }

                * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a [google.protobuf.Type][]

                * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on the

                  lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved

            `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer message along
            with a

            URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


            Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values in the
            form

            of utility functions or additional generated methods of the Any
            type.


            Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                Foo foo = ...;
                Any any;
                any.PackFrom(foo);
                ...
                if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                  ...
                }

            Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                Foo foo = ...;
                Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                ...
                if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                  foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                }

             Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                foo = Foo(...)
                any = Any()
                any.Pack(foo)
                ...
                if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                  any.Unpack(foo)
                  ...

             Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                 foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                 any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                 if err != nil {
                   ...
                 }
                 ...
                 foo := &pb.Foo{}
                 if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                   ...
                 }

            The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default use

            'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the unpack

            methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last '/'

            in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield type

            name "y.z".



            JSON

            ====

            The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

            representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an

            additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example:

                package google.profile;
                message Person {
                  string first_name = 1;
                  string last_name = 2;
                }

                {
                  "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                  "firstName": <string>,
                  "lastName": <string>
                }

            If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON

            representation, that representation will be embedded adding a field

            `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type`

            field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                {
                  "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
                  "value": "1.212s"

    description: |-
      SignMode represents a signing mode with its own security guarantees.

      This enum should be considered a registry of all known sign modes
      in the Cosmos ecosystem. Apps are not expected to support all known
      sign modes. Apps that would like to support custom  sign modes are
      encouraged to open a small PR against this file to add a new case
      to this SignMode enum describing their sign mode so that different
      apps have a consistent version of this enum.

       - SIGN_MODE_UNSPECIFIED: SIGN_MODE_UNSPECIFIED specifies an unknown signing mode and will be
      rejected.
       - SIGN_MODE_DIRECT: SIGN_MODE_DIRECT specifies a signing mode which uses SignDoc and is
      verified with raw bytes from Tx.
       - SIGN_MODE_TEXTUAL: SIGN_MODE_TEXTUAL is a future signing mode that will verify some
      human-readable textual representation on top of the binary representation
      from SIGN_MODE_DIRECT. It is currently not supported.
       - SIGN_MODE_DIRECT_AUX: SIGN_MODE_DIRECT_AUX specifies a signing mode which uses
      SignDocDirectAux. As opposed to SIGN_MODE_DIRECT, this sign mode does not
      require signers signing over other signers' `signer_info`. It also allows
      for adding Tips in transactions.

       - SIGN_MODE_LEGACY_AMINO_JSON: SIGN_MODE_LEGACY_AMINO_JSON is a backwards compatibility mode which uses
      Amino JSON and will be removed in the future.
       - SIGN_MODE_EIP_191: SIGN_MODE_EIP_191 specifies the sign mode for EIP 191 signing on the Cosmos
      SDK. Ref: https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-191

      Currently, SIGN_MODE_EIP_191 is registered as a SignMode enum variant,
      but is not implemented on the SDK by default. To enable EIP-191, you need
      to pass a custom `TxConfig` that has an implementation of
      `SignModeHandler` for EIP-191. The SDK may decide to fully support
      EIP-191 in the future.

                  In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary all
                  types that they

                  expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for URLs
                  which use the

                  scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally set
                  up a type

                  server that maps type URLs to message definitions as follows:


                  * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                  * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a [google.protobuf.Type][]
                    value in binary format, or produce an error.
                  * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on
                  the
                    URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                    lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                    on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                    breaking changes.)

                  Note: this functionality is not currently available in the
                  official

                  protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning
                  with

                  type.googleapis.com.


                  Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme) might
                  be

                  used with implementation specific semantics.

                  protocol buffer message. This string must contain at least

                  one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path must
                  represent

                  the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                  `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in a

                  (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                  In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary all
                  types that they

                  expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for URLs
                  which use the

                  scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally set
                  up a type

                  server that maps type URLs to message definitions as follows:


                  * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                  * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a [google.protobuf.Type][]
                    value in binary format, or produce an error.
                  * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on
                  the
                    URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                    lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                    on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                    breaking changes.)

                  Note: this functionality is not currently available in the
                  official

                  protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning
                  with

                  type.googleapis.com.


                  Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme) might
                  be

                  used with implementation specific semantics.

                    which use the

                    scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally set
                    up a type

                    server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                    follows:


                    * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                    * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                    [google.protobuf.Type][]
                      value in binary format, or produce an error.
                    * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on
                    the
                      URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                      lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                      on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                      breaking changes.)

                    Note: this functionality is not currently available in the
                    official

                    protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning
                    with

                    type.googleapis.com.


                    Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                    might be

                    used with implementation specific semantics.

                `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer message
                along with a

                URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values in
                the form

                of utility functions or additional generated methods of the Any
                type.


                Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                    Foo foo = ...;
                    Any any;
                    any.PackFrom(foo);
                    ...
                    if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                      ...
                    }

                Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                    Foo foo = ...;
                    Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                    ...
                    if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                      foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                    }

                 Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                    foo = Foo(...)
                    any = Any()
                    any.Pack(foo)
                    ...
                    if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                      any.Unpack(foo)
                      ...

                 Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                     foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                     any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                     if err != nil {
                       ...
                     }
                     ...
                     foo := &pb.Foo{}
                     if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                       ...
                     }

                The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default
                use

                'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                unpack

                methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last
                '/'

                in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield type

                name "y.z".



                JSON

                ====

                The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an

                additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example:

                    package google.profile;
                    message Person {
                      string first_name = 1;
                      string last_name = 2;
                    }

                    {
                      "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                      "firstName": <string>,
                      "lastName": <string>
                    }

                If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON

                representation, that representation will be embedded adding a
                field

                `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type`

                field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                    {
                      "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
                      "value": "1.212s"

                    expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for URLs

                    server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                    follows:


                    * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                    * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                    [google.protobuf.Type][]
                      value in binary format, or produce an error.
                    * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on
                    the
                      URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                      lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                      on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                      breaking changes.)

                    Note: this functionality is not currently available in the

                    protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning
                    with

                    type.googleapis.com.


                    Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                    might be

                    used with implementation specific semantics.

                URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values in
                the form

                of utility functions or additional generated methods of the Any
                type.


                Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                    Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                    ...
                    if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                      foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                    }

                 Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                    foo = Foo(...)
                    any = Any()
                    any.Pack(foo)
                    ...
                    if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                      any.Unpack(foo)
                      ...

                 Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                     foo := &pb.Foo{...}

                The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default
                use

                'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                unpack

                methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last
                '/'

                in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield type

                    }

                    {

                (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).

                use the

                scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally set up
                a type

                server that maps type URLs to message definitions as follows:


                * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a [google.protobuf.Type][]
                  value in binary format, or produce an error.
                * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on the
                  URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                  lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                  on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                  breaking changes.)

                Note: this functionality is not currently available in the
                official

                protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning
                with

                type.googleapis.com.


                Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme) might
                be

                used with implementation specific semantics.

            `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer message along
            with a

            URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


            Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values in the
            form

            of utility functions or additional generated methods of the Any
            type.


            Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                Foo foo = ...;
                Any any;
                any.PackFrom(foo);
                ...
                if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                  ...
                }

            Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                Foo foo = ...;
                Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                ...
                if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                  foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                }

             Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                foo = Foo(...)
                any = Any()
                any.Pack(foo)
                ...
                if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                  any.Unpack(foo)
                  ...

             Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                 foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                 any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                 if err != nil {
                   ...
                 }
                 ...
                 foo := &pb.Foo{}
                 if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                   ...
                 }

            The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default use

            'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the unpack

            methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last '/'

            in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield type

            name "y.z".



            JSON

            ====

            The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

            representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an

            additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example:

                package google.profile;
                message Person {
                  string first_name = 1;
                  string last_name = 2;
                }

                {
                  "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                  "firstName": <string>,
                  "lastName": <string>
                }

            If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON

            representation, that representation will be embedded adding a field

            `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type`

            field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                {
                  "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
                  "value": "1.212s"

          added to

          the list only the first time it occurs.

          By convention, the first required signer (usually from the first

                lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved

              A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of the
              serialized

              protocol buffer message. This string must contain at least

              one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path must
              represent

              the fully qualified name of the type (as in

              `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in a
              canonical form

              (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


              In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary all types
              that they

              expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for URLs which
              use the

              scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally set up a
              type

              server that maps type URLs to message definitions as follows:


              * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

              * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a [google.protobuf.Type][]
                value in binary format, or produce an error.
              * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on the
                URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                breaking changes.)

              Note: this functionality is not currently available in the
              official

              protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning with

              type.googleapis.com.


              Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme) might be

              used with implementation specific semantics.

                  A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of the
                  serialized

                  protocol buffer message. This string must contain at least

                  one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path must
                  represent

                  the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                  `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in a
                  canonical form

                  (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                  In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary all
                  types that they

                  expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for URLs
                  which use the

                  scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally set
                  up a type

                  server that maps type URLs to message definitions as follows:


                  * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                  * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a [google.protobuf.Type][]
                    value in binary format, or produce an error.
                  * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on
                  the
                    URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                    lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                    on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                    breaking changes.)

                  Note: this functionality is not currently available in the
                  official

                  protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning
                  with

                  type.googleapis.com.


                  Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme) might
                  be

                  used with implementation specific semantics.

                  types that they

                  expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for URLs
                  which use the

                  scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally set
                  up a type

                  server that maps type URLs to message definitions as follows:


                  * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                  * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a [google.protobuf.Type][]
                    value in binary format, or produce an error.
                  * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on
                  the
                    URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                    lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                    on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                    breaking changes.)

                  Note: this functionality is not currently available in the
                  official

                  protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning
                  with

                  type.googleapis.com.


                  Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme) might
                  be

                  used with implementation specific semantics.

                   if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                     ...
                   }

              The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default use

              'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
              unpack

              methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last '/'

              in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield type

              name "y.z".



              JSON

              ====

              The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

              representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an

              additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example:

                  package google.profile;
                  message Person {
                    string first_name = 1;
                    string last_name = 2;
                  }

                  {
                    "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                    "firstName": <string>,
                    "lastName": <string>
                  }

              If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON

              representation, that representation will be embedded adding a
              field

              `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type`

              field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                  {
                    "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

              the fully qualified name of the type (as in

              `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in a
              canonical form

              (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


              In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary all types
              that they

              expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for URLs which
              use the

              scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally set up a
              type

              server that maps type URLs to message definitions as follows:


              * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

              * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a [google.protobuf.Type][]
                value in binary format, or produce an error.
              * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on the
                URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                breaking changes.)

              Note: this functionality is not currently available in the
              official

              protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning with

              type.googleapis.com.


              Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme) might be

              used with implementation specific semantics.

          `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer message along
          with a

          URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


          Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values in the
          form

          of utility functions or additional generated methods of the Any type.


          Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

              Foo foo = ...;
              Any any;
              any.PackFrom(foo);
              ...
              if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                ...
              }

          Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

              Foo foo = ...;
              Any any = Any.pack(foo);
              ...
              if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
              }

           Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

              foo = Foo(...)
              any = Any()
              any.Pack(foo)
              ...
              if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                any.Unpack(foo)
                ...

           Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

               foo := &pb.Foo{...}
               any, err := anypb.New(foo)
               if err != nil {
                 ...
               }
               ...
               foo := &pb.Foo{}
               if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                 ...
               }

          The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default use

          'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the unpack

          methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last '/'

          in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield type

          name "y.z".

              type

              * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

              * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a [google.protobuf.Type][]
                value in binary format, or produce an error.
              * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on the
                URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                breaking changes.)

              Note: this functionality is not currently available in the
              official

              protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning with

          `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer message along
          with a

          URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


          Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values in the
          form

          of utility functions or additional generated methods of the Any type.


          Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

              Foo foo = ...;
              Any any;
              any.PackFrom(foo);
              ...
              if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                ...
              }

          Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

              Foo foo = ...;
              Any any = Any.pack(foo);
              ...
              if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
              }

           Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

              foo = Foo(...)
              any = Any()
              any.Pack(foo)
              ...
              if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                any.Unpack(foo)
                ...

           Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

               foo := &pb.Foo{...}
               any, err := anypb.New(foo)
               if err != nil {
                 ...
               }
               ...
               foo := &pb.Foo{}
               if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                 ...
               }

          The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default use

          'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the unpack

          methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last '/'

          in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield type

          name "y.z".



          JSON

          ====

          The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

          representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an

          additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example:

              package google.profile;
              message Person {
                string first_name = 1;
                string last_name = 2;
              }

              {
                "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                "firstName": <string>,
                "lastName": <string>
              }

          If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON

          representation, that representation will be embedded adding a field

          `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type`

          field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

              {
                "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
                "value": "1.212s"

              server that maps type URLs to message definitions as follows:


              * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

              * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a [google.protobuf.Type][]
                value in binary format, or produce an error.
              * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on the
                URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                breaking changes.)

              Note: this functionality is not currently available in the
              official

              protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning with

              type.googleapis.com.


              Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme) might be

              used with implementation specific semantics.

          `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer message along
          with a

          URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


          Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values in the
          form

          of utility functions or additional generated methods of the Any type.


          Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

              Foo foo = ...;
              Any any;
              any.PackFrom(foo);
              ...
              if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                ...
              }

          Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

              Foo foo = ...;
              Any any = Any.pack(foo);
              ...
              if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
              }

           Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

              foo = Foo(...)
              any = Any()
              any.Pack(foo)
              ...
              if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                any.Unpack(foo)
                ...

           Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

               foo := &pb.Foo{...}
               any, err := anypb.New(foo)
               if err != nil {
                 ...
               }
               ...
               foo := &pb.Foo{}
               if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                 ...
               }

          The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default use

          'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the unpack

          methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last '/'

          in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield type

          name "y.z".



          JSON

          ====

          The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

          representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an

          additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example:

              package google.profile;
              message Person {
                string first_name = 1;
                string last_name = 2;
              }

              {
                "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                "firstName": <string>,
                "lastName": <string>
              }

          If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON

          representation, that representation will be embedded adding a field

          `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type`

          field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

              {
                "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
                "value": "1.212s"

          reset the height in certain conditions e.g. hard forks, state-machine

          breaking changes In these cases, the RevisionNumber is incremented so

          height continues to be monitonically increasing even as the
          RevisionHeight

                    one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path must
                    represent

                    the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                      on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage

          `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer message along
          with a

          URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


          Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values in the
          form

          of utility functions or additional generated methods of the Any type.


          Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

              Foo foo = ...;
              Any any;
              any.PackFrom(foo);
              ...
              if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                ...
              }

          Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

              Foo foo = ...;
              Any any = Any.pack(foo);
              ...
              if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
              }

           Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

              foo = Foo(...)
              any = Any()
              any.Pack(foo)
              ...
              if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                any.Unpack(foo)
                ...

           Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

               foo := &pb.Foo{...}
               any, err := anypb.New(foo)
               if err != nil {
                 ...
               }
               ...
               foo := &pb.Foo{}
               if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                 ...
               }

          The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default use

          'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the unpack

          methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last '/'

          in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield type

          name "y.z".



          JSON

          ====

          The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

          representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an

          additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example:

              package google.profile;
              message Person {
                string first_name = 1;
                string last_name = 2;
              }

              {
                "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                "firstName": <string>,
                "lastName": <string>
              }

          If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON

          representation, that representation will be embedded adding a field

          `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type`

          field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

              {
                "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
                "value": "1.212s"

                    one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path must
                    represent

                    the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                    `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in a
                    canonical form

                    (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                    In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary all
                    types that they

                    expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for URLs
                    which use the

                    scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally set
                    up a type

                    server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                    follows:


                    * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                    * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                    [google.protobuf.Type][]
                      value in binary format, or produce an error.
                    * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on

                 ...
               }
               ...
               foo := &pb.Foo{}

                 ...
               }

          The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default use

          'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the unpack

          methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last '/'

          in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield type

          name "y.z".



          JSON

          ====

          The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

          representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an

          additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example:

              package google.profile;
              message Person {
                string first_name = 1;
                string last_name = 2;
              }

              {
                "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                "firstName": <string>,
                "lastName": <string>
              }

          If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON

          representation, that representation will be embedded adding a field

          `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type`

          field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

              {
                "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
                "value": "1.212s"
              }

              one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path must
              represent

              the fully qualified name of the type (as in

              `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in a
              canonical form

              (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


              In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary all types
              that they

              expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for URLs which
              use the

              scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally set up a
              type

              server that maps type URLs to message definitions as follows:


              * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

              * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a [google.protobuf.Type][]
                value in binary format, or produce an error.
              * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on the
                URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                breaking changes.)

              Note: this functionality is not currently available in the
              official

              protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning with

              type.googleapis.com.


              Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme) might be

              used with implementation specific semantics.

          `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer message along
          with a

          URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


          Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values in the
          form

          of utility functions or additional generated methods of the Any type.


          Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

              Foo foo = ...;
              Any any;
              any.PackFrom(foo);
              ...
              if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                ...
              }

          Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

              Foo foo = ...;
              Any any = Any.pack(foo);
              ...
              if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
              }

           Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

              foo = Foo(...)
              any = Any()
              any.Pack(foo)
              ...
              if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                any.Unpack(foo)
                ...

           Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

               foo := &pb.Foo{...}
               any, err := anypb.New(foo)
               if err != nil {
                 ...
               }
               ...
               foo := &pb.Foo{}
               if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                 ...
               }

          The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default use

          'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the unpack

          methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last '/'

          in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield type

          name "y.z".



          JSON

          ====

          The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

          representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an

          additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example:

              package google.profile;
              message Person {
                string first_name = 1;
                string last_name = 2;
              }

              {
                "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                "firstName": <string>,
                "lastName": <string>
              }

          If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON

          representation, that representation will be embedded adding a field

          `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type`

          field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

              {
                "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                    URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                    lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                    on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                    breaking changes.)

                  official

                  protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning
                  with

                  type.googleapis.com.


                  Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme) might
                  be

              `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer message
              along with a

              URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


              Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values in the
              form

              of utility functions or additional generated methods of the Any
              type.


              Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                  Foo foo = ...;
                  Any any;
                  any.PackFrom(foo);
                  ...
                  if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                    ...
                  }

              Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                  Foo foo = ...;
                  Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                  ...
                  if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                    foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                  }

               Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                  foo = Foo(...)
                  any = Any()
                  any.Pack(foo)
                  ...
                  if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                    any.Unpack(foo)
                    ...

               Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                   foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                   any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                   if err != nil {
                     ...
                   }
                   ...
                   foo := &pb.Foo{}
                   if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                     ...
                   }

              The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default use

              'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
              unpack

              methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last '/'

              in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield type

              name "y.z".



              JSON

              ====

              The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

              representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an

              additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example:

                  package google.profile;
                  message Person {
                    string first_name = 1;
                    string last_name = 2;
                  }

                  {
                    "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                    "firstName": <string>,
                    "lastName": <string>
                  }

              If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON

              representation, that representation will be embedded adding a
              field

              `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type`

              field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                  {
                    "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

              (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


              In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary all types
              that they

              expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for URLs which
              use the

              scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally set up a
              type

              server that maps type URLs to message definitions as follows:


              * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

              * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a [google.protobuf.Type][]
                value in binary format, or produce an error.
              * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on the
                URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                breaking changes.)

      As demonstrated in tests, if we don't fix the algorithm used to calculate
      the

      LeafHash for a given tree, there are many possible key-value pairs that
      can

      generate a given hash (by interpretting the preimage differently).

      tree format server uses. But not in code, rather a configuration object.

                As demonstrated in tests, if we don't fix the algorithm used to
                calculate the

                LeafHash for a given tree, there are many possible key-value

              In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary all types
              that they

              expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for URLs which
              use the

              scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally set up a
              type

              server that maps type URLs to message definitions as follows:


              * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

              * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a [google.protobuf.Type][]
                value in binary format, or produce an error.
              * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on the
                URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                breaking changes.)

              Note: this functionality is not currently available in the
              official

              protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning with

              type.googleapis.com.


              Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme) might be

              used with implementation specific semantics.

          `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer message along
          with a

          URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


          Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values in the
          form

          of utility functions or additional generated methods of the Any type.


          Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

              Foo foo = ...;
              Any any;
              any.PackFrom(foo);
              ...
              if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                ...
              }

          Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

              Foo foo = ...;
              Any any = Any.pack(foo);
              ...
              if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
              }

           Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

              foo = Foo(...)
              any = Any()
              any.Pack(foo)
              ...
              if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                any.Unpack(foo)
                ...

           Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

               foo := &pb.Foo{...}
               any, err := anypb.New(foo)
               if err != nil {
                 ...
               }
               ...
               foo := &pb.Foo{}
               if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                 ...
               }

          The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default use

          'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the unpack

          methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last '/'

          in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield type

          name "y.z".



          JSON

          ====

          The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

          representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an

          additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example:

              package google.profile;
              message Person {
                string first_name = 1;
                string last_name = 2;
              }

              {
                "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                "firstName": <string>,
                "lastName": <string>
              }

          If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON

          representation, that representation will be embedded adding a field

          `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type`

          field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

              {
                "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
                "value": "1.212s"
              }

        type: object
        properties:
          '@type':
            type: string
            description: >-

              one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path must

              the fully qualified name of the type (as in

              scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally set up a

          Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

              Foo foo = ...;
              Any any = Any.pack(foo);

                foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
              }

           Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

              foo = Foo(...)
              any = Any()
              any.Pack(foo)
              ...
              if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                any.Unpack(foo)
                ...

           Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

               foo := &pb.Foo{...}
               any, err := anypb.New(foo)
               if err != nil {
                 ...
               }
               ...
               foo := &pb.Foo{}
               if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                 ...
               }

          The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default use

          'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the unpack

          methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last '/'

          in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield type

          name "y.z".



          JSON

          ====

          The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

          representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an

          additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example:

              package google.profile;
              message Person {
                string first_name = 1;
                string last_name = 2;
              }

              {
                "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                "firstName": <string>,
                "lastName": <string>
              }

          If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON

          representation, that representation will be embedded adding a field

          `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type`

          field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

              {
                "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
                "value": "1.212s"

                      A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of
                      the serialized

                      protocol buffer message. This string must contain at least

                      one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path must
                      represent

                      the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                      `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in a
                      canonical form

                      (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                      In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary all
                      types that they

                      expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for URLs
                      which use the

                      scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                      set up a type

                      server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                      follows:


                      * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                      * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                      [google.protobuf.Type][]
                        value in binary format, or produce an error.
                      * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                      on the
                        URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                        lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                        on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                        breaking changes.)

                      Note: this functionality is not currently available in the
                      official

                      protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                      beginning with

                      type.googleapis.com.


                      Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                      might be

                      used with implementation specific semantics.

                  `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer message
                  along with a

                  URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                  Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values in
                  the form

                  of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                  Any type.


                  Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                      Foo foo = ...;
                      Any any;
                      any.PackFrom(foo);
                      ...
                      if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                        ...
                      }

                  Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                      Foo foo = ...;
                      Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                      ...
                      if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                        foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                      }

                   Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                      foo = Foo(...)
                      any = Any()
                      any.Pack(foo)
                      ...
                      if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                        any.Unpack(foo)
                        ...

                   Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                       foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                       any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                       if err != nil {
                         ...
                       }
                       ...
                       foo := &pb.Foo{}
                       if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                         ...
                       }

                  The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default
                  use

                  'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                  unpack

                  methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last
                  '/'

                  in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                  type

                  name "y.z".



                  JSON

                  ====

                  The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                  representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an

                  additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example:

                      package google.profile;
                      message Person {
                        string first_name = 1;
                        string last_name = 2;
                      }

                      {
                        "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                        "firstName": <string>,
                        "lastName": <string>
                      }

                  If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                  JSON

                  representation, that representation will be embedded adding a
                  field

                  `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type`

                  field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                      {
                        "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                  representation, that representation will be embedded adding a
                  field

                  `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type`

                  up a type

                  server that maps type URLs to message definitions as follows:


                  * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                  * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a [google.protobuf.Type][]
                    value in binary format, or produce an error.
                  * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on
                  the
                    URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                    lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                    on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                    breaking changes.)

                  Note: this functionality is not currently available in the
                  official

                  protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning
                  with

                  type.googleapis.com.


                  Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme) might
                  be

                  used with implementation specific semantics.

              `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer message
              along with a

              URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


              Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values in the
              form

              of utility functions or additional generated methods of the Any
              type.


              Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                  Foo foo = ...;
                  Any any;
                  any.PackFrom(foo);
                  ...
                  if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                    ...
                  }

              Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                  Foo foo = ...;
                  Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                  ...
                  if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                    foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                  }

               Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                  foo = Foo(...)
                  any = Any()
                  any.Pack(foo)
                  ...
                  if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                    any.Unpack(foo)
                    ...

               Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                   foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                   any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                   if err != nil {
                     ...
                   }
                   ...
                   foo := &pb.Foo{}
                   if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                     ...
                   }

              The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default use

              'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
              unpack

              methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last '/'

              in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield type

              name "y.z".



              JSON

              ====

              The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

              representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an

              additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example:

                  package google.profile;
                  message Person {
                    string first_name = 1;
                    string last_name = 2;
                  }

                  {
                    "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                    "firstName": <string>,
                    "lastName": <string>
                  }

              If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON

              representation, that representation will be embedded adding a
              field

              `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type`

              field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                  {
                    "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
                    "value": "1.212s"

                  any.Pack(foo)
                  ...
                  if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                    any.Unpack(foo)
                    ...

               Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                   foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                   any, err := anypb.New(foo)
                   if err != nil {
                     ...
                   }
                   ...
                   foo := &pb.Foo{}
                   if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
                     ...
                   }

              The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default use

              'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
              unpack

              methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last '/'

              in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield type

              name "y.z".



              JSON

              ====

              The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

              representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an

              additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example:

                  package google.profile;
                  message Person {
                    string first_name = 1;
                    string last_name = 2;
                  }

                  {
                    "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                    "firstName": <string>,
                    "lastName": <string>
                  }

              If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON

              representation, that representation will be embedded adding a
              field

              `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type`

              field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                  {
                    "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
                    "value": "1.212s"
