                    and the framework knows that the v2 module should receive
                    all the same state

      SignMode represents a signing mode with its own security guarantees.

      This enum should be considered a registry of all known sign modes
      in the Cosmos ecosystem. Apps are not expected to support all known
      sign modes. Apps that would like to support custom  sign modes are
      encouraged to open a small PR against this file to add a new case
      to this SignMode enum describing their sign mode so that different
      apps have a consistent version of this enum.

       - SIGN_MODE_UNSPECIFIED: SIGN_MODE_UNSPECIFIED specifies an unknown signing mode and will be
      rejected.
       - SIGN_MODE_DIRECT: SIGN_MODE_DIRECT specifies a signing mode which uses SignDoc and is
      verified with raw bytes from Tx.
       - SIGN_MODE_TEXTUAL: SIGN_MODE_TEXTUAL is a future signing mode that will verify some
      human-readable textual representation on top of the binary representation
      from SIGN_MODE_DIRECT.

      Since: cosmos-sdk 0.50
       - SIGN_MODE_DIRECT_AUX: SIGN_MODE_DIRECT_AUX specifies a signing mode which uses
      SignDocDirectAux. As opposed to SIGN_MODE_DIRECT, this sign mode does not
      require signers signing over other signers' `signer_info`.

      Since: cosmos-sdk 0.46
       - SIGN_MODE_LEGACY_AMINO_JSON: SIGN_MODE_LEGACY_AMINO_JSON is a backwards compatibility mode which uses
      Amino JSON and will be removed in the future.

      SDK. Ref: https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-191

      Currently, SIGN_MODE_EIP_191 is registered as a SignMode enum variant,
      but is not implemented on the SDK by default. To enable EIP-191, you need
      to pass a custom `TxConfig` that has an implementation of

      EIP-191 in the future.

                                  verified with raw bytes from Tx.
                                   - SIGN_MODE_TEXTUAL: SIGN_MODE_TEXTUAL is a future signing mode that will verify some

                                  but is not implemented on the SDK by default.
                                  To enable EIP-191, you need

                                  to pass a custom `TxConfig` that has an
                                  implementation of

                                  `SignModeHandler` for EIP-191. The SDK may
                                  decide to fully support

                                  EIP-191 in the future.

                                  To enable EIP-191, you need

                            Amino JSON and will be removed in the future.
                             - SIGN_MODE_EIP_191: SIGN_MODE_EIP_191 specifies the sign mode for EIP 191 signing on the Cosmos
                            SDK. Ref: https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-191


                            Currently, SIGN_MODE_EIP_191 is registered as a
                            SignMode enum variant,

                            but is not implemented on the SDK by default. To
                            enable EIP-191, you need

                            to pass a custom `TxConfig` that has an
                            implementation of

                            `SignModeHandler` for EIP-191. The SDK may decide to
                            fully support

                            EIP-191 in the future.

                                 - SIGN_MODE_UNSPECIFIED: SIGN_MODE_UNSPECIFIED specifies an unknown signing mode and will be
                                rejected.
                                 - SIGN_MODE_DIRECT: SIGN_MODE_DIRECT specifies a signing mode which uses SignDoc and is
                                verified with raw bytes from Tx.
                                 - SIGN_MODE_TEXTUAL: SIGN_MODE_TEXTUAL is a future signing mode that will verify some

                                SIGN_MODE_DIRECT, this sign mode does not

                                Currently, SIGN_MODE_EIP_191 is registered as a
                                SignMode enum variant,

                                but is not implemented on the SDK by default. To
                                enable EIP-191, you need

                                to pass a custom `TxConfig` that has an
                                implementation of

                                `SignModeHandler` for EIP-191. The SDK may
                                decide to fully support

                                EIP-191 in the future.

                                 - SIGN_MODE_UNSPECIFIED: SIGN_MODE_UNSPECIFIED specifies an unknown signing mode and will be
                                rejected.
                                 - SIGN_MODE_DIRECT: SIGN_MODE_DIRECT specifies a signing mode which uses SignDoc and is
                                verified with raw bytes from Tx.
                                 - SIGN_MODE_TEXTUAL: SIGN_MODE_TEXTUAL is a future signing mode that will verify some

                                but is not implemented on the SDK by default. To
                                enable EIP-191, you need

                                to pass a custom `TxConfig` that has an
                                implementation of

                                `SignModeHandler` for EIP-191. The SDK may
                                decide to fully support

                                EIP-191 in the future.

                          The basic formula for calculating this is:

                    amount of the

                    Validator's bond shares and their exchange rate to coins.
                    Slashing results in

                    a decrease in the exchange rate, allowing correct
                    calculation of future

                    undelegations without iterating over delegators. When coins
                    are delegated to

                    this validator, the validator is credited with a delegation
                    whose number of

                    bond shares is based on the amount of coins delegated
                    divided by the current

                    exchange rate. Voting power can be calculated as total
                    bonded shares

                    multiplied by exchange rate.

                                        default. To enable EIP-191, you need

                                        may decide to fully support

                                        EIP-191 in the future.

                                        Currently, SIGN_MODE_EIP_191 is
                                        registered as a SignMode enum variant,

                                        but is not implemented on the SDK by
                                        default. To enable EIP-191, you need

                                        to pass a custom `TxConfig` that has an
                                        implementation of

                                        `SignModeHandler` for EIP-191. The SDK
                                        may decide to fully support

                                        EIP-191 in the future.

                                        verified with raw bytes from Tx.
                                         - SIGN_MODE_TEXTUAL: SIGN_MODE_TEXTUAL is a future signing mode that will verify some

                                        Currently, SIGN_MODE_EIP_191 is
                                        registered as a SignMode enum variant,

                                        but is not implemented on the SDK by
                                        default. To enable EIP-191, you need

                                        to pass a custom `TxConfig` that has an
                                        implementation of

                                        `SignModeHandler` for EIP-191. The SDK
                                        may decide to fully support

                                        EIP-191 in the future.

                                          registered as a SignMode enum variant,

                                          but is not implemented on the SDK by
                                          default. To enable EIP-191, you need

                                          to pass a custom `TxConfig` that has an
                                          implementation of

                                          `SignModeHandler` for EIP-191. The SDK
                                          may decide to fully support

                                          EIP-191 in the future.

                                          but is not implemented on the SDK by
                                          default. To enable EIP-191, you need

                                          to pass a custom `TxConfig` that has an
                                          implementation of

                                          `SignModeHandler` for EIP-191. The SDK
                                          may decide to fully support

                                          EIP-191 in the future.

                                        Currently, SIGN_MODE_EIP_191 is
                                        registered as a SignMode enum variant,

                                        but is not implemented on the SDK by
                                        default. To enable EIP-191, you need

                                        to pass a custom `TxConfig` that has an
                                        implementation of

                                        `SignModeHandler` for EIP-191. The SDK
                                        may decide to fully support

                                        EIP-191 in the future.
