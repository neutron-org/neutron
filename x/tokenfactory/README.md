# Token Factory (by Osmosis Labs)

> This module was taken from Osmosis chain codebase (commit: https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis/commit/9e178a631f91ffc91c51f3665ed915c9f15e1807). The reason of this action was to adapt module and tests to our codebase because it was not possible to import it without code modification
> that was made by Osmosis team to the original Cosmos SDK. These changes made it not possible (without deep modifications of the whole code) to import module to our code.
> Also support of the creation fee was removed at the moment because we do not have community pool in the Neutron. 


The tokenfactory module allows any account to create a new token with
the name `factory/{creator address}/{subdenom}`. Because tokens are
namespaced by creator address, this allows token minting to be
permissionless, due to not needing to resolve name collisions. A single
account can create multiple denoms, by providing a unique subdenom for each
created denom. Once a denom is created, the original creator is given
"admin" privileges over the asset. This allows them to:

- Mint their denom to any account
- Burn their denom from any account
- Create a transfer of their denom between any two accounts
- Change the admin In the future, more admin capabilities may be
    added. Admins can choose to share admin privileges with other
    accounts using the authz module. The `ChangeAdmin` functionality,
    allows changing the master admin account, or even setting it to
    `""`, meaning no account has admin privileges of the asset.


## Messages

### CreateDenom
- Creates a denom of `factory/{creator address}/{subdenom}` given the denom creator address and the subdenom. Subdenoms can contain `[a-zA-Z0-9./]`.
``` {.go}
message MsgCreateDenom {
  string sender = 1 [ (gogoproto.moretags) = "yaml:\"sender\"" ];
  string subdenom = 2 [ (gogoproto.moretags) = "yaml:\"subdenom\"" ];
}
```

**State Modifications:**
- Fund community pool with the denom creation fee from the creator address, set in `Params`
- Set `DenomMetaData` via bank keeper
- Set `AuthorityMetadata` for the given denom to store the admin for the created denom `factory/{creator address}/{subdenom}`. Admin is automatically set as the Msg sender
- Add denom to the `CreatorPrefixStore`, where a state of denoms created per creator is kept

### Mint
- Minting of a specific denom is only allowed for the creator of the denom registered during `CreateDenom`
``` {.go}
message MsgMint {
  string sender = 1 [ (gogoproto.moretags) = "yaml:\"sender\"" ];
  cosmos.base.v1beta1.Coin amount = 2 [
    (gogoproto.moretags) = "yaml:\"amount\"",
    (gogoproto.nullable) = false
  ];
}
```

**State Modifications:**
- Safety check the following
  - Check that the denom minting is created via `tokenfactory` module
  - Check that the sender of the message is the admin of the denom
- Mint designated amount of tokens for the denom via `bank` module



### Burn
- Burning of a specific denom is only allowed for the creator of the denom registered during `CreateDenom`
``` {.go}
message MsgBurn {
  string sender = 1 [ (gogoproto.moretags) = "yaml:\"sender\"" ];
  cosmos.base.v1beta1.Coin amount = 2 [
    (gogoproto.moretags) = "yaml:\"amount\"",
    (gogoproto.nullable) = false
  ];
}
```

**State Modifications:**
- Safety check the following
  - Check that the denom minting is created via `tokenfactory` module
  - Check that the sender of the message is the admin of the denom
- Burn designated amount of tokens for the denom via `bank` module


### ChangeAdmin
- Burning of a specific denom is only allowed for the creator of the denom registered during `CreateDenom`
``` {.go}
message MsgChangeAdmin {
  string sender = 1 [ (gogoproto.moretags) = "yaml:\"sender\"" ];
  string denom = 2 [ (gogoproto.moretags) = "yaml:\"denom\"" ];
  string newAdmin = 3 [ (gogoproto.moretags) = "yaml:\"new_admin\"" ];
}
```

**State Modifications:**
- Check that sender of the message is the admin of denom
- Modify `AuthorityMetadata` state entry to change the admin of the denom

## Expectations from the chain

The chain's bech32 prefix for addresses can be at most 16 characters long.

This comes from denoms having a 128 byte maximum length, enforced from the SDK, and us setting longest_subdenom to be 44 bytes.
A token factory token's denom is:
`factory/{creator address}/{subdenom}`
Splitting up into sub-components, this has:
* `len(factory) = 7`
* `2 * len("/") = 2`
* `len(longest_subdenom)`
* `len(creator_address) = len(bech32(longest_addr_length, chain_addr_prefix))`.
Longest addr length at the moment is `32 bytes`.
Due to SDK error correction settings, this means `len(bech32(32, chain_addr_prefix)) = len(chain_addr_prefix) + 1 + 58`.
Adding this all, we have a total length constraint of `128 = 7 + 2 + len(longest_subdenom) + len(longest_chain_addr_prefix) + 1 + 58`.
Therefore `len(longest_subdenom) + len(longest_chain_addr_prefix) = 128 - (7 + 2 + 1 + 58) = 60`.

The choice between how we standardized the split these 60 bytes between maxes from longest_subdenom and longest_chain_addr_prefix is somewhat arbitrary. Considerations going into this:
* Per [BIP-0173](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0173.mediawiki#bech32) the technically longest HRP for a 32 byte address ('data field') is 31 bytes. (Comes from encode(data) = 59 bytes, and max length = 90 bytes)
* subdenom should be at least 32 bytes so hashes can go into it
* longer subdenoms are very helpful for creating human readable denoms
* chain addresses should prefer being smaller. The longest HRP in cosmos to date is 11 bytes. (`persistence`)

For explicitness, its currently set to `len(longest_subdenom) = 44` and `len(longest_chain_addr_prefix) = 16`.

Please note, if the SDK increases the maximum length of a denom from 128 bytes, these caps should increase.
So please don't make code rely on these max lengths for parsing.
